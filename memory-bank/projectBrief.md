# Project Brief

## Purpose

SK UI is a responsive, accessible React component library built on top of Base UI primitives, plus a Next.js site that serves as a playground and documentation. The goal is to provide styling-agnostic, composable components with first-class responsiveness and a lightweight theming system.

## Target Users

- Frontend engineers building React applications
- Design/UX teams needing consistent UI building blocks
- Product engineers who prefer unopinionated, accessible primitives with opt-in styling
